# üõ∞Ô∏è Lab 2.03 ‚Äì Reinforced deployment protocol

## **Taints, Tolerations & Anti-Affinity**

### üõ°Ô∏è *Imperial Defense Grid: Post-Endor isolation protocol*

Following the catastrophic oversight on the original Star Destroyer, the Empire is rolling out **enhanced pod scheduling policies** to lock down its most critical nodes.

To defend the newly-commissioned Star Destroyer node from unauthorized access‚Äîand prevent TIE Fighters from clustering and risking simultaneous failure‚Äîyou‚Äôll use:

* üõë **Taints** to repel unauthorized pods
* üõ°Ô∏è **Tolerations** for privileged scheduling
* üß© **Anti-affinity rules** to distribute TIE Fighters safely across Star Destroyer sectors

> *"We will not suffer another flaw in our station‚Äôs design. Isolation and alignment ensure control."* ‚Äì Director Krennic

## üéØ Mission objectives

Secure the new **Star Destroyer node** by:

* Labeling it with Imperial allegiance: `alliance=Empire`
* Applying a **taint** to restrict access: `access=restricted:NoSchedule`
* Updating the **TIE Squadron Deployment** to:
  * Tolerate the Star Destroyer node‚Äôs taint
  * Use **pod anti-affinity** to prevent clustering on the same node
* Testing that a **Rebel craft** (e.g., X-wing) is denied access

## üß≠ Step-by-step: securing the station

### ‚öôÔ∏è Phase I: Fortify the Star Destroyer Node

1. **Add an extra node pool**

Deploy a hardened node pool to serve as the Star Destroyer fleet platform:

```bash
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-imperial-outpost"
export CLUSTER_NAME="aks-imperial-core"
export NODE_SIZE="Standard_E4ads_v6"
```

```bash
az aks nodepool add \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
  --name destroyer \
  --node-count 3 \
  --node-vm-size $NODE_SIZE \
  --node-osdisk-type Ephemeral \
  --node-osdisk-size 64 \
  --mode User \
  --labels "alliance=Empire" \
  --node-taints "access=restricted:NoSchedule"
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Phase II: Configure Authorized TIE Fighter Deployment

2. **Modify your `squadron.yaml`**

Update the TIE squadron Deployment to:

* Add a **toleration** for `access=restricted:NoSchedule`
* Include **anti-affinity rules** to prevent TIE Fighters from clustering on a single node

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Phase III: Launch the Squadron

3. **Apply your Deployment**

```bash
kubectl apply -f squadron.yaml
```

4. **Verify Pod Placement**

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

‚úÖ Confirm that pods:

* **Only land** on tainted Star Destroyer nodes
* Are **spread out** across different nodes via anti-affinity
* Have **not been scheduled** onto unapproved (untainted) nodes

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Phase IV: test Rebel infiltration

5. Taint the `aks-systempool` and `aks-userpool` nodes with `access=restricted:NoSchedule`
```bash
kubectl taint node aks-systempool-<<identifier>> access=restricted:NoSchedule
kubectl taint node aks-systempool-<<identifier>> access=restricted:NoSchedule
```

6. **Attempt to Deploy a Rebel Craft**

Create a pod with **no toleration**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: xwing
spec:
  containers:
    - name: xwing
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f xwing.yaml
```

‚õî This pod should remain **unscheduled**, blocked by the taint on the Star Destroyer node.

```bash
kubectl describe pod xwing
```

Look for a message like:

> `0/3 nodes are available: 3 node(s) had taint {access=restricted: NoSchedule}, that the pod didn't tolerate.`

7. Untaint the `aks-systempool` and `aks-userpool` nodes
```bash
kubectl taint node aks-systempool-<<identifier>> access=restricted:NoSchedule-
kubectl taint node aks-systempool-<<identifier>> access=restricted:NoSchedule-
```

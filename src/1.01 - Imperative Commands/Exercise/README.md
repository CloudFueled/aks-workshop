# ðŸŒŒ Lab 1.01 - Imperial Rapid Deployment â€“ mastering imperative commands

Sometimes, as an officer of the Empire, you must act swiftlyâ€”no time to craft manifests or YAML files. In the heat of battle, the ability to deploy and manage resources with a few typed commands can be the difference between victory and defeat.

In this exercise, you will **use only imperative `kubectl` commands** to complete your orders. No YAML files, just direct, immediate action.

---

## ðŸ§­ Step-by-step: complete your Imperial Orders using imperative commands

1. Deploy a pod named `nginx` using the `nginx:alpine` image

2. Deploy a pod named `redis` with image `redis:alpine` and label `tier=db`

3. Create a ClusterIP service named `redis-service` to expose redis on port 6379

4. Create a deployment named `webapp` using the image `busybox` with 3 replicas. What do you spot when checking the deployment `webapp`? Do you know why?

5. Create a pod named `custom-nginx` using the `nginx` image, exposing container port 8080

6. Create a namespace named `dev-ns`

7. Create a deployment named `redis-deploy` in namespace `dev-ns` using image `redis` with 2 replicas

8. Create a pod named `httpd` using the image `httpd:alpine` in the `default` namespace and expose it as a ClusterIP service named `httpd` targeting port 80 (as few steps as possible)

9. Create a pod interactively named `curl` using the image `curlimages/curl:latest` in the `default` namespace, and curl the httpd pod

ðŸ§¾ **Expected output**: <Your Answer>

10. Generate a YAML file for a deployment named `stormtrooper` using image `nginx`, without creating it

11. Restart the `webapp` deployment to simulate a redeploy scenario

12. Scale the `webapp` deployment to 5 replicas

13. Port forward traffic from your local machine (port 8080) to the httpd service (port 80). What do you see when you access `http://localhost:8080`?

ðŸ”— Then access:
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
ðŸ§¾ Youâ€™ll see the default Apache web page from the `httpd` pod.

14. Create a ConfigMap named `app-config` with the following key-value pairs:

* `ENV=prod`
* `LOG_LEVEL=debug`


15. Create a Secret named `db-secret` with:

* `username=admin`
* `password=imperial123`

### Common `kubectl` verbs

Below are some commonly used verbs with `kubectl` and their purposes:

- **apply**: Apply a configuration to a resource by filename or stdin.
- **create**: Create a resource from a file or stdin.
- **delete**: Delete resources by file, name, or label selector.
- **get**: Display one or more resources.
- **describe**: Show detailed information about a specific resource or group of resources.
- **edit**: Edit a resource on the server.
- **logs**: Print the logs for a container in a pod.
- **exec**: Execute a command in a container.
- **scale**: Scale the number of replicas for a deployment, replica set, or replication controller.
- **rollout**: Manage the rollout of a resource (e.g., deployment).
- **port-forward**: Forward one or more local ports to a pod.
- **top**: Display resource (CPU/memory) usage of nodes or pods.
- **patch**: Update fields of a resource using a patch.
- **cp**: Copy files and directories to and from containers.
- **replace**: Replace a resource by filename or stdin.
- **annotate**: Add or update the annotations of a resource.
- **label**: Add or update the labels of a resource.

### Example commands

- **Get cluster info**:
  ```bash
  kubectl cluster-info
  ```
- **Get all nodes**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get node
  ```
- **Describe specific node**:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe node <node>
  ```
- **Get all namespaces**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespace
  ```
- **Change namespace**:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace <namespace>
  ```
- **List all pods**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```
- **Apply a configuration file**:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f <file.yaml>
  ```
- **Describe a resource**:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe <resource> <name>
  ```
- **Delete a resource**:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete <resource> <name>
  ```

Replace `<resource>` with the type of resource (e.g., pod, service, deployment) and `<name>` with the name of the resource.

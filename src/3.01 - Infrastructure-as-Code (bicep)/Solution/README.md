# üß± Lab 3.01 - Imperial Archives ‚Äì Infrastructure as Code with Bicep

### **Galactic security protocol ‚Äì operation Vault Shield**

The loss of the Death Star was catastrophic, not just militarily‚Äîbut in terms of exposed Imperial secrets. To prevent future breaches, **all sensitive assets must be protected with ironclad policy, encrypted storage, and secure identity boundaries.**

Using **Bicep**, the Empire‚Äôs official Infrastructure as Code standard, you are now assigned to build a **resilient and policy-enforced Kubernetes base**, complete with **network controls** and **vaulted secrets**.

> _"Without control, there is chaos. With Bicep and network policy, there is order."_ ‚Äì Grand Moff Tarkin

## üéØ Mission objectives

You will:

- Extend an existing `main.bicep` file
- Add a **User Assigned Managed Identity** with **Federated Credentials** for secrets integration
- Deploy a **Key Vault** in a dedicated resource group with RBAC
- Store a top-secret value
- Enable **Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS)** and **L7 Network Policies** on your AKS cluster after provisioning

---

## üß≠ Step-by-step: orders from the Imperial DevSecOps command

1. Create / extend the modules

- Define a **User Assigned Managed Identity** module in the modules folder:

  - Use the `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities@2025-01-31-preview` API version
  - Set the `location` to the same as the AKS cluster
  - Use a unique name for the identity
  - Create a federated credential with the following specifications:

    - audience: `api://AzureADTokenExchange`
    - issuer: the oidcIssuerURL from the AKS cluster
    - subject: `system:serviceaccount:external-secrets:sa-external-secrets`

- Extend the Azure Key Vault module in the modules folder:

  - Add a roleAssignments parameter to the Key Vault module
  - Add a resource roleAssignment that loops over the entries in the roleAssignments parameter


2.  Review and Extend the `main.bicep`

Locate the `main.bicep` file and complete the following TODOs:

- Define a **Key Vault Resource Group** in the `main.bicep` file:

  - Define it as a `resource`
  - Use the same location as the AKS cluster

- Define and deploy an **User Managed Identity** with the created module.
- Define and deploy a **Key Vault** with the modified module.
- Assign the Managed Identity to the Key Vault with the `Key Vault Administrator` role
- Assign yourself to the Key Vault with the `Key Vault Administrator` role
- Make sure the tags are propagated to all resources, including the Key Vault and Managed Identity.

3.  Deploy the Resources

First, register the necessary feature for Advanced Networking:

```bash
az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview
```

Then, ensure you have the latest version of the `aks-preview` extension:

```bash
az extension add --name aks-preview
az extension update --name aks-preview
```

Use the following command to deploy:

```bash
az deployment sub create \
  --location francecentral \
  --template-file main.bicep \
  --name aks-imperial-outpost \
  --parameters params/midSector.bicepparam
```

> üõ∞Ô∏è _ACNS ensures your cluster enforces advanced network segmentation, crucial for preventing Rebel interference._

4.  Confirm the ACNS Configuration

```bash
az aks show \
  --resource-group rg-imperial-outpost-aks \
  --name aks-imperial-outpost \
  --query networkProfile.advancedNetworking.security
```

You should see:

- `enabled: true`
- `advancedNetworkPolicies: L7`

5. Fetch the credentials to be able to connect to the cluster

```bash
az aks get-credentials \
  --resource-group <Resource Group Name> \
  --name <Cluster Name> 
```

6. Manually add a Key Vault secret in the newly created Key Vault
